####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. A soldier, Lord, thou hast me made
Thou art my Captain, Priest and Head;
And under thee I sure will fight
The fight of faith with all my might.
The cross all stain'd with hallow'd blood,
The ensign of our conquering Lord,
The Christian soldier's standard is,
And I will fight for King Jesus.

2. Then, 

0 my Lord, keep me, I pray',
That I may run the narrow way,
And front my duty ne'er depart.
But live to Christ with all my heart;
Help me to walk in humbleness
March in the way of holiness.
Oh, make me pure and spotless too,
And fit to stand the grand review.

3. That when our general shall come,
With sound of trumpet, not of drum,
'Tis then our well dress'd ranks shall stand
In full review at God's right hand.
And when our foes shall get the route,
Anti Jesus wheels them left about,
Then we'll march up the golden street,
And ground our arms at Jesus' feet.

4. The war is o'er, and we are free
To join the bloodâ€”wash'd company
Our wages shall be harps of old,
And songs of praise that can't be told.
There we shall drink rich drafts of wine
The band of music we shall join,
And hallelujah's highest key
Shall be our theme eternally.

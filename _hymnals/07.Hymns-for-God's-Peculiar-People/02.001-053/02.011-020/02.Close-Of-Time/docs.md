####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Time now is closing, Jesus will come;
Signs are fulfilling, earth's pillars groan:
Hark! hear the trumpet calls come home—
See earth reeling to her final doom.

2. See slumbering millions rise from the earth;
Christ calls his people from south, from north—
Come home, my people, time is no more,
I've wash'd your robes white, your conflicts are o'er

3. Hastening to see Thee, my soul would rise
To meet my Saviour in yonder skies;
With all the ransom'd who've gone before,
There I shall hail Thee on that peaceful shore,

4 

0, there'll be glory, joy, peace and love,
Nothing to harm thee in heaven above:

0, let us be faithful, and we'll be blest,
When Jesus leads us to eternal rest.

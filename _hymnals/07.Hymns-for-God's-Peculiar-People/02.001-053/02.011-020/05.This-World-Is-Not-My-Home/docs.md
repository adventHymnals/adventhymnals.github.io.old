####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Farewell! farewell! to all below,
My Jesus calls and I must go:
I'll launch my boat upon the sea,
This land is not the land for me.
This world is not my home;
This world is not my home;
This world is all a wilderness;
This world is not my home.

2. I found the winding path of sin
A rugged path to travel in;
Beyond this fading world I see
The land the Saviour bought for me.
This world is not my home, &c.

3. Farewell! my friends ! I'll not stay here—
The home I seek will soon appear;
Where Christ is not, I cannot be;
This land is not the land for me.
This world is not my home, &c.

4. Praise be to God our hope's on high;
The angels sing and so do I
Where seraphs bow and bend the knee,

0 that's the land—the land for me.
This world is not my home, &c.

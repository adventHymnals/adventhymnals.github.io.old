####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. The last lovely morning
All blooming and fair,
Is fast onward fleeting,
And soon will appear!
While the mighty, mighty, mighty, trump
Sounds “Come, come away!”
O! let us be ready
To hail the glad day.

2. And when that bright morning
In splendor shall dawn,
Our tears will be ended,
Our sorrows all gone.
While the mighty. &c.

3. The Bridegroom from glory
To earth shall descend ;
Ten thousand bright angels
Around him attend.
While the mighty, &c.

4. The graves will be open'd,The dead will arise,
And with the Redeemer
Mount up to the skies.
While the mighty, &c.

5 The saints then immortal,
In glory shall reign!
The Bride with the Bridegroom
Forever remain.
While the mighty, &.c.

```txt
1. Holy Bible! Book divine!
Precious treasure, thou art mine
Mine, to tell me whence I came;
Mine, to teach one what I am;
Mine, to chide me when I rove;
Mine, to show a Saviour's love;
Mine, art thou, to guide my feet;
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit.

2. Mine, to comfort in distress,
If the Holy Spirit bless;
Mine, to show, by living faith,
Man can triumph over death;
Mine, to tell of joys to come,
And the rebel sinner's doom;

0, thou precious book divine!
Precious treasure, thou art mine.

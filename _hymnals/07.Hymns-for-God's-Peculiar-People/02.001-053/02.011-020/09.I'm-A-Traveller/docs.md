####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. I'm a lonely trav'ller here,
Weary, opprest;
But my journey's end is near,
Soon I shall rest.
Dark and dreary is the way,
Toiling I've come—
Ask me not with you to stay—
Yonder's my home.

2. I'm a weary trav'ller here,
I must go on,
For my journey's end is near—
I must be gone.
Brighter joys than earth can give;
Win me away;
Pleasures, that for ever live—
I cannot stay.

3. I'm a trav'ller to a land
Where all is fair;
Where is seen no broken band—
All, all are there;
Where no tear shall ever fall,
Nor heart be sad;
Where the glory is for all,
And all are glad.

4. I'm a trav'ller, and I go
Where all is fair;
Farewell all I've lov'd below—
I must be there.
Worldly honors, hopes and gain,
All I resign;
Welcome sorrow, grief and pain.
If heav'n be mine.

5. I'm a trav'ller—call me not—
Upward's my way;
Yonder is my rest and lot,
I cannot stay.
Farewell earthly pleasures all,
Pilgrim I'll roam,
Hail me not—in vain you call—
Yonder's my home.

1. Our Father who in heaven art,
Hallowed be thy name;
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
In heav'n and earth the same.
DOUBLE CHORUS.
Come, my Saviour, 

0 my Saviour,
Come and bless thy people now,
While at thy feet we humbly bow,

0 come and save us now.
Then will we sing our suff'rings o'er,
And praise thee evermore;
Then will we sing our suff'rings o'er,
And praise thee evermore.

2. Give us this day our daily bread;
Our trespasses forgive;
As we forgive our fellowâ€”men,
May we thy grace receive.
Come, my Saviour, &c.

3. And in temptation leave us not;
From evil us defend;
For Thine, 

0 Lord, the kingdom is,
For ever, without end.
Come, my Saviour, &c.

4. Thine is the power, 

0 Lord, to bring
The kingdom down to men;
Thine is the glory evermore,
And kingdom without end.
Come, my Saviour, &c.

5. In that glad day shall all thy saints
A joyful tribute bring,
Of praise and power, of joy and song,
To their exalted King.
Come, my Saviour, &c.

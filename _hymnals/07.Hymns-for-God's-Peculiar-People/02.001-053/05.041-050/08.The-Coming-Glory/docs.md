####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. I'm glad I know that Christ shall reign
In glory, glory, glory;
And come to earth in clouds again,
In glory, glory, glory;
'Tis glory's fortaste makes me sing,
Of glory, glory, glory;
And to my Saviour praises bringSing glory, glory, glory.

2. I hope to see Him on the throne
In glory, glory, glory;
When He shall come to claim his own,
In glory, glory, glory;
I'll sing while mounting through the air,
Of glory, glory, glory;
To meet my Father's children there,
In glory, glory, glory;

3. Come on, dear friends, let's mend our pace,
To glory, glory, glory;
We soon shall see Him face to face,
In glory, glory, glory.
The Bride shall reign, the Bridegroom too,
In glory, glory, glory;
Let's keep the blessed prize in view,
'Tis glory, glory, glory.

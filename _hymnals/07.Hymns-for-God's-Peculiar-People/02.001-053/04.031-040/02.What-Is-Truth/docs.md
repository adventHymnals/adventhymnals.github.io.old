## 032. WHAT IS TRUTH?
####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Truth is the gem for which we seek!

0, tell us where shall it be found;
For this we search and pray and weep,
That truth may in our hearts abound.

2. We want the truth on every point;
We want it too to practice by.
Do thou, 

0 Lord, our eyes anoint
With a fresh unction from on high.

3. Were not the Ten Commandments given
By the great source of light and truth,
For ALL who tread the path to heav'n
From the dark wilderness of earth!

4. Then as we would our God obey,
In letter and in spirit too,

0 let us keep the seventh day,
For it is plainly brought to view.

## 037. TRUE JOYS
####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. O tell me no more
Of this world's vain store,
The time for such trifles
With me now is o'er.

2. A city I've found
Where true joys abound;
To dwell I'm determin'd
On this happy ground.

3. My soul, don't delay,
He calls thee away;
Rise, follow thy Saviour,
And bless the glad day.

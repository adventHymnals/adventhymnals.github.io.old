####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Jesus, I my cross have taken,
All to leave and follow thee;
All things else I have forsaken;
Thou from hence my all shalt be.
Perish every fond ambition,
All I've sought, or hop'd, or known;
Yet how rich is my condition,
While I prove the Lord my own.

2. Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me,
Thou art faithful, thou art true.
O, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
While thy love is left to me;

0,'t were not in joy to charm me,
If that love be hid from me.

3. Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Arm'd by faith, and wing'd by pray’r;
Heaven's eternal day’s before thee;
God's own hand shall guide thee there
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise!

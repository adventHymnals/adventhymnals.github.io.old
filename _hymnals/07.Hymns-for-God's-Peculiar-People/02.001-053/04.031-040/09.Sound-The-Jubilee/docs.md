####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. While I was down in Egypt's land,
I heard my Saviour was at hand;
And the midnight cry was sounding,
And I wanted to be free;
So I left my former brethren,
To sound the Jubilee.

2. Though opposition waxes strong,
Yet still the battle won't be long,
For our blessed Lord is coming;
He will set the captives free;
Still keep up good courage, brethren,
And sound the Jubilee.

3. The battle is not to the strong,
The weak may sing the conqueror's song;
Then lift lip your heads rejoicing,
Who are glad our Lord to see;
Bless the Lord, our souls are happy,
While we sound the Jubilee.

4. A little longer here below,
Then home to glory we shall go, I believe it, I believe it.
Hallelujah now I see,
That we soon shall be with Jesus;
In the glorious Jubilee.

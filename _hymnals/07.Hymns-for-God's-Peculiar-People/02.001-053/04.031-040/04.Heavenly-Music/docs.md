## 034. HEAVENLY MUSIC
####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. What heavenly music steals over the sea,
Entrancing the senses like sweet melody?
'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;
'Tis for me they are singing, their welcome I hear!

2. On the banks of old Jordan here gazing I stand,
And earnestly longing I stretch forth my hand;
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray
Let me join that sweet music, come take me away.

3. Though dark are the waters, and rough is the wave.
If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave,
For that heavenly music hath ravish'd me so,
I must join in the chorus, I'll go, let me go.

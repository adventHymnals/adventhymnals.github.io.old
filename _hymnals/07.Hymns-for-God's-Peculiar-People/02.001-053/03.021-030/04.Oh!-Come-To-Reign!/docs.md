####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People

1. Mark that pilgrim—lowly bending,
At the shrine of prayer—ascending,
Praise and sighs together blending,
From his lips in mournful strain;
Glowing with sincere contrition,
And with childlike, blest submission,Ever riseth this petition
“Jesus, come—oh! come to reign."

2. List again;—the low earth sigheth,
And the blood of martyrs crieth
From its bosom, where there lieth
Millions upon millions slain;
"Lord, how long, ere thy word given,
All the wicked shall be driven
From the earth by bolts of heaven I
Jesus come—oh ! come to reign."

3. Kingdoms now are reeling, falling,
Nations lie in wo appalling,
On their sages vainly calling
All these wonders to explain;
While the slain around are lying,
God's own little flock are sighing,
And in secret places crying,
“Jesus come—oh! come to reign."

4. Here the wicked live securely,
Of to-morrow boasting surely,
While from those who're walking purely
They extort dishonest gain;
Yea, the meek are burden'd, driven;
Want and care to them are given,
But they lift the cry to Heaven,
“Jesus come—oh! come to reign."

5. Christian, CHEER THEE—land is nearing,
Still be hopeful—nothing fearing,
Soon in majesty appearing,
You'll behold the Lamb once slain;
Oh 

1 how joyful then to hear him,
While all nations shall revere him,
Saying to his flock who fear him,
'" I have come—on earth to reign."

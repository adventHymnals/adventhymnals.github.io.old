1. Christian, thy warfare soon will be o'er;
Oh, do not fear, do not fear,
Soon thou shalt rest where thy foes come no more—
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.
What though the night be so dreary and long,
What though thy foes be unwearied and strong,
Soon thou shalt join in the conqueror's song—
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.

2. What though the billows of life darkly roll,
Oh, do not fear, do not fear;
Friends all forsake thee, and cares press thy soul,
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.
Christian, remember that Christ loves thee still
Only be faithful, and do Jesus' will,
Soon thou wilt stand with Him on Zion's hill—
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.

3. Christian, the angels will soon come for thee,
Oh, do not fear, do not fear;
He whom thou lovest in glory thou'lt see—
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.
Oh, if thou would'st to the end firm endure,
Keep thy robe holy and spotless and pure,
Victorious faith will make Canaan sure—
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.

4. Christian, the shadows will soon flee away;
Oh, do not fear, do not fear;
Then thou wilt enter an eternal day,
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.
In the "bright kingdom” for ever to dwell,
Join angel choirs, and the rich anthem swell;
Bid to thy sorrow a long, long farewell!
Be of good cheer, of good cheer.

        Hymns for God's Peculiar People 028. The Friend In Need. The friends that flee when trials come, Are not the friends for me; Like frighted birds, ah! see how soon— Their place will vacant be. But there's a Friend I dearly love, Who for me left the realms above, And died upon the tree— Oh! that's the Friend for me, &c.

####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. The friends that flee when trials come,
Are not the friends for me;
Like frighted birds, ah! see how soon—
Their place will vacant be.
But there's a Friend I dearly love,
Who for me left the realms above,
And died upon the tree—
Oh! that's the Friend for me, &c.

2. This world, with all its fleeting show,
Is not the world for me;
'Tis mix'd with many tears of wo,
And scenes of misery.But there's a world so pure and fair,
And all the saints shall enter there,
From sin and sorrow free—
Oh! that's the world for me, &c.

3. A city fair, for saints a home,
From God is coming down;
His children rest, no more to roam,
In New Jerusalem.
Oh! Jesus, come! come quickly! come,
We long to see our heavenly home
Of Immortality—
Oh! that's the home for me, &c.

####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1 Be perfect—holiness persue;
In love be sure to dwell,
And God through Christ will comfort you,
So brethren all farewell.

2. Be of one mind—give God your hearts;
And of his mercies tell,
Which he, through grace, to you imparts,
So brethren all farewell.

3. Now live in peace and holy fear
In love strive to excel;
For Christ our King will soon appear,
So brethren all farewell.

4. The God of love and peace adore,
And on his mercy dwell,
We hope to meet on Canaan's shore,
So brethren all farewell.

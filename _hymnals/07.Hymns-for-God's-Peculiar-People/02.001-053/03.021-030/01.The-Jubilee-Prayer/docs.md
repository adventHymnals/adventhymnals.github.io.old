####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Gracious Father, guard thy children
From the foes' destructive pow’r;
Save, 

0 save them Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.
Thou wilt surely prove thy people,
All our graces must be tried;
But thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

2. We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.
Keep us, Lord, till thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted, from the world;
Let thy Holy Spirit cheer us,Till thy banner is unfurl'd.

3. With what joyful exultation
Shall the saints thy banner see,
When the Lord for whom we've waited,
Shall proclaim the Jubilee:
Freedom from this world's pollutions;
Freedom from all sin and pain;
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
And from Death's destructive reign.

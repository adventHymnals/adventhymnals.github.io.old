## 025. BRIGHT SCENES OF GLORY
####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Bright scenes of glory strike my sense,
And all my passions capture;
Eternal beauties round me shine,
Infusing warmest rapture.
I dive in pleasures deep and full,
In swelling waves of glory;
And feel my Saviour in my soul
And groan to tell my story.

2. I feast on honey, milk and wine,
I drink perpetual sweetness;
Mount Zion's odours cheer my mind,
While Christ unfolds his glory,
No mortal tongue can show my joys,
Nor can an angel tell them;
Ten thousand times surpassing all
Terrestrial worlds or emblems.

3. My captivated spirits fly
Through shining worlds of beauty;
Dissolv'd in blushes, loud I cry,
In praises loud and mighty,
And here I'll sing and swell the strains
Of harmony, delighted;
And with the millions learn the notes
Of saints in Christ united.

4. When earth and seas shall pass away,
And all their glory vanish;
When Christ shall come on earth to reign,
And all the wicked perish,
My joys refin'd, shall higher shine,
With heaven's radiant glory,
And tell through one eternal day,
Love's all immortal story.

        Hymns for God's Peculiar People 023. Here Is No Rest. Here o'er the earth as a stranger I roam, Here is no rest—is no rest ; Here as a pilgrim I wander alone, Yet I am blest—I am blest. CHORUS. For I look forward to that glorious day, When sin and sorrow will vanish away, My heart doth leap while I hear Jesus say, There, there is rent—there is rest.

1. Here o'er the earth as a stranger I roam,
Here is no rest—is no rest ;
Here as a pilgrim I wander alone,
Yet I am blest—I am blest.
CHORUS.
For I look forward to that glorious day,
When sin and sorrow will vanish away,
My heart doth leap while I hear Jesus say,
There, there is rent—there is rest.

2. Here fierce temptations beset me around;
Here is no rest—is no rest;
Here am I griev'd while my foes me surround;
Yet I am blest—I am blest.
CHORUS.
Let them revile me, and scoff at my name,
Laugh at my weeping—endeavor to shame;
I will go forward, for this is my theme;
There, there is rest—there is rest.

3. Here are afflictions and trials severe;
Here is no rest—is no rest;
Here I must part with the friends I hold dear;
Yet I am blest—I am blest.
CHORUS.
Sweet is the promise I read in his word;
Blessed are they who have died in the Lord;
They will be call'd to receive their reward;—
Then there is rest—there is rest.

4. This world of cares is a wilderness state,
Here is no rest—is no rest;
Here I must bear from the world all its hate—
Yet I am blest—I am blest.
CHORUS.
Soon shall I be from the wicked released,
Soon shall the weary for ever be blest,
Soon shall I lean upon Jesus' breast—
Then there is rest—there is rest.

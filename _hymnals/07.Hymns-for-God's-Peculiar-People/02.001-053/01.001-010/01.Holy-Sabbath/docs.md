####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. The pure, unfailing Word of God
Foundation ever sure
Its statutes, precepts and its laws,
Are written for the pure.

2. In paradise where man was led,
The word will safely guide;
And if he should this law evade,
His steps would surely slide.

3. The Holy Sabbath here was made,
Which God did sanctify;
And if we would our God obey,
We must with this comply.

4. In after times, when Moses liv'd,
This law was ratified
And all who keet this holy word,
May know they're sanctified.

5. Still farther down the stream of time,
We hear the prophet say
Hearken, fear not reproach nor shame,
Who keep the seventh day.

6. For thus the Mighty God hath said
To those who truly rest,
Thou shalt on the high places ride,
And feed among the blest.

7. Here too are they who patient are,
And keep commandments pure,
They'll in the Holy City share,
If to the end endure.

8. Then let us still pursue this road,
Till we fair Canaan gain,
Then we shall walk the street of gold,
And in that rest remain.

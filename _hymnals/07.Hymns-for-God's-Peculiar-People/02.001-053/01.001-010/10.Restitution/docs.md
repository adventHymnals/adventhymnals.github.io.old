        Hymns for God's Peculiar People 010. Restitution. Oh, spare Thy people, Lord, And bring them full salvation; Fulfill Thy faithful Word, Rescue the sleeping nation. Thou voice of God shout from on high; The signal give for reaping; Come Thou and reap the harvest dry; Oh gather all the sleeping: Spare now the “remnant” Lord, The foe doth yet persue them, Oh for Thy blessed word, Do Thou with strength renew them.

####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Oh, spare Thy people, Lord,
And bring them full salvation;
Fulfill Thy faithful Word,
Rescue the sleeping nation.
Thou voice of God shout from on high;
The signal give for reaping;
Come Thou and reap the harvest dry;
Oh gather all the sleeping:
Spare now the “remnant” Lord,
The foe doth yet persue them,
Oh for Thy blessed word,
Do Thou with strength renew them.

2. Oh, may thy kingdom come,
All power and dominion;
Bring now the faithful home,
On bright seraphic pinion
We're tried, 

0, come and take us home,
And give us crowns of glory,
We feel like those who weary roam
About some ruin hoary
Oh, may thy will be done.
On earth as 'tis in heaven;
May now the glorious Sun
Of righteousness be given.

3. Oh! may the "City" come
Down from the opening heaven
The New Jerusalem,
Oh, may it now be given!
Its gates of pearl, its streets of gold,
Blaze with Thy brightest glory
The holy seers have raptur'd told
The new Creation's story!
Oh, may it now descend,
The City of foundations,
In triumph ne'er to end;
Rule Thou the "angry nations."

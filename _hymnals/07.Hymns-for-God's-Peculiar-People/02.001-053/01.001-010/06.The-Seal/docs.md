####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Behold a light appears,
The holy Sabbath day,
And magnified so clear,
That none may need to stray;
Though small at first, as sun beam's ray,
Its strength ascends to perfect day.

2. It is the message clear
Ascending from the east,
God's servants now appear
Who will not worship "BEAST;"
Four angels hold the winds reveal'd,
Until God's servants all are seal'd.

3. Hebrews in Egypt's land
Must all receive a sign,
When forth from Pharaoh's hand
Deliverance was design'd;
A sign, a token, thus shall be,
Before the earth and heavens flee.

4. The Sabbath is a sign,
A mark which all may see,
And sure will draw a line
When servants all are seal'd,
And while destructionâ€™s in the land
This mark will guard the waiting band.

5. Then wrath in vengeance comes,
The great and dreadful day!
God's voice in thunder tones,
Shakes heaven and earth and sea;
Ye living saints who faithful be,
No plague shall e'er come nigh to thee.

6. 

0 God, the living God,
Do thou the seal apply,
And from destruction's rod,
Oh! keep us lest we die;
And while the storm of wrath descends,
Oh ! hide us, till the earth be cleans'd.

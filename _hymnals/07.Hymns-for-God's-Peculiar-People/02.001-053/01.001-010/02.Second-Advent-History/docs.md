## 002. SECOND ADVENT HISTORY
####  Hymns for God's Peculiar People
```txt
1. Lo! an angel loud proclaiming,
With the gospel of good news,
To every kindred, tongue and people;
Fear the Lord; give glory due;
Proclamation
Of the hour of judgement near.

2. Lo! another angel follows,
With another solemn cry!
Babylon the great is fallen,
Peals like thunder through the sky:
Let "thy people,"
Now forsake her POIS'NOUS CREEDS.

3. Yet, a third and solemn message,
Now proclaims a final doom;
All who "worship Beast or Image;"
Soon shall drink the wrath of God
Without mixture,
Mercy now no longer pleads.

4. Here are they, who now are waiting,
And have patience to endure;
While the DRAGON'S hosts are raging,
These confide in God secure
Faith of Jesus;
And COMMANDMENTS, keep them pure.

5. Hear a voice from heav'n proclaiming,
"Write" the message, "firm decree,"
Bless'd are they, who die in Jesus,
"From hence forth" for ever be
The Spirit sanctions,
And the Saints ADORE His LAW.

—An Old Hymn.

1. When Jesus Christ was here below,
He taught his people what to do:
And if we would his precepts keep,
We must attend to washing feet.
For on that night he was betray'd,
He for us all a pattern laid
Soon as his supper He did eat,
He rose and wash'd his brethren's feet.

2. The Lord who made the earth and sky,
Arose and laid his garments by;
And wash'd their feet to show that we;
Like Christ, should always humble be.
He wash'd them all, tho' all were clean,
Save Judas, who was full of sin.
May none of us, like Judas, sell
Our Lord for gold, and go to hell.

3. Said Peter, Lord, it shall not be;
Thou shalt not stoop to washing me
Oh! that no Christian now may say,
I cannot Jesus' word obey.
Ye call me Lord and Master too;
Then do as I have done to you;
All my commands and sayings keep,
And show your love by washing feet

4. Ye shall be happy, if ye know
And do these things, by faith below;
For I'll protect you till I come,
And then I'll take you to your home
The Lord of glory stoops to men,
And an example sets for them
If in humility complete,
Salute the saints and wash their feet.

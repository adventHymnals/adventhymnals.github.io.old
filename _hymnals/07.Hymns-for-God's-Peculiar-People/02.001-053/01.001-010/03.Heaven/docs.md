1. We speak of the joys of the blest—
Of that country so bright and so fair;
And oft are its glories confest;
But what must it be to be there?
We speak of its pathway of gold;
Of its walls deck'd with jewels so rare,
Of its wonders and pleasures untold
But what must it be to be there?

2. We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation and care,
From trials without and within
But what must it be to be there?
We speak of its service of love;
Of the robes which the glorified wear;
Of the Church of the first born above,
But what must it be to be there?

3. Do Thou 'midst temptation or wo,
Still for heaven my Sprit prepare;
And shortly I also shall know,
And feel what it is to be there.
Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam,
In glory celestial and fair,
With saints and with angels at home,
And Jesus himself will be there.

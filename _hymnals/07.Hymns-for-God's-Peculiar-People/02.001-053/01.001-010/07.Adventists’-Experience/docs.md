1. Hail, partners in the Advent band!
Your race is almost run
God’s led you with his own right hand,
Since looking for his Son.
All hail, ye lov'd ones of my God,
Come listen to my song,
While I recount the steps we've trod,
Nor shall the strain be long.

2 In forty—three, each took his lamp,
Went forth to meet the Lord;
And nothing then our faith could damp,
We lean'd on the sure word.
How sweet and cheering was the sound
That fell upon our ears
How swiftly flew the echo round,
The Lord will come this year!

3. But, forty—three flew quickly by
And left us toiling here;
Then slumber stole upon each eye
And closed each listening ear.
In forty—four, we heard a cry
At midnight pealing forth—
Behold, the heavenly Bridegroom's nigh,
He'll soon descend to earth.

4. It truly was a solemn cry,
As ever earth did hear
Like many waters rushing by,
It fell upon the ear.
Each virgin rose and trimm'd the lamp,
With eager haste went out
From north to south, throughout the camp,
Was heard one mighty shout.

5. Each heart with solemn rapture swelt'd,
As we proclaim'd the cry—
Nor heeded we the scoffs that fell
From many a passer by.
Like ancient men of Galilee,
We gaz'd into the sky,
Doubtless our Lord we soon should see
Descending from on high.

6. Our longing eyes were rais'd in vain,
To meet Him in the air,
For 'twas not so, the Bridegroom came,
His Bride's not here, but there.
There to the fair Jerusalem,
Unseen by mortal eye,
Jesus our King and Priest did come,
Thus answering to the cry.

7. 'Tis there, within the pearly gates,
A marriage feast is spread
'Twas purchas'd for the scatter'd saints
By Christ, their living Head.
Then let us patient wait awhile,
Till we those joys do see;
There we shall bask beneath his smile
To all eternity.

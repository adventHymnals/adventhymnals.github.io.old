        Hymns for God's Peculiar People 005. The Joys Of Eden. How sweet to reflect on those joys that await me In yon blissful region, the haven of rest, Where bright holy angels with welcome shall greet me. And lead me to mansions prepar'd for the blest. Encircled in light, and with glory enshrouded, My happiness perfect, my mind's sky unclouded, I'll bathe in the ocean of pleasure unbounded, And range with delight through the Eden of Love.

1. How sweet to reflect on those joys that await me
In yon blissful region, the haven of rest,
Where bright holy angels with welcome shall greet me.
And lead me to mansions prepar'd for the blest.
Encircled in light, and with glory enshrouded,
My happiness perfect, my mind's sky unclouded,
I'll bathe in the ocean of pleasure unbounded,
And range with delight through the Eden of Love.

2. While angelic legions, with harps tun'd celestial,
Harmoniously join in the concert of praise,
The saints, as they flock from the regions terrestrial,
In loud hallejujahs their voices will raise
Then songs to the Lamb shall re—echo thro' heaven,
My soul will respond, to Immanuel be given,
All glory, all honor, all might and dominion,
Who brought us through grace to the Eden of Love

3. Then hail, blessed state! hail, ye songsters of glory!
Ye harpers of bliss, soon I'll meet you above,
And join your full choir in rehearsing the story,
“Salvation from sorrow, through Jesus' love:"
Though 'prison'd in earth, yet, by anticipation,
Already my soul feels a sweet prelibation
Of joys that await me, when freed from probation;
My heart's now in heaven, the Eden, of Love.

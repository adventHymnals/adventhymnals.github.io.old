0 HAIL, HAPPY DAY.

1. 

0 hail, happy day, that speaks our trials ended,
Our Lord has come to take us home;

0 hail, happy day;
No more by doubts or fears distress'd,
We now shall gain our promis'd rest,
And be for ever blest; 

0 hail, happy day.

2. Swell loud the glad note, our bondage now is over;
The jubilee proclaims us free;

0 hail, happy day;
The day that brings a sweet release,
That crowns our Jesus Prince
And bids our sorrows cease;

0 hail, happy day.

3. 

0 hail, happy day, 
that ends our tears and sorrow,
That brings us joy without alloy,

0 hail, happy day
There peace shall wave her scepter high
And love's fair banner greet the eye,
Proclaiming victory; 

0 hail, happy day.

4. We hail thy bright beams, 
0 morn of Zion’s glory,
Thy blessed light breaks on our sight,

0 hail, happy day;
Fair Beulah’s fields before us rise,
And sweetly burst upon our eyes,
The joys of Paradise; 

0 hail happy day.

5. Thrice hail, happy day, 
when earth shall smile in gladness,
And Eden bloom o'er nature’s tomb,

0 hail, happy day;
Where life's pellucid waters glide,
Safe by the dear Redeemer's side,
For ever we'll abide; 

0 hail, happy day.
